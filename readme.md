# VC Resource Center Website
## This is the source code for the website I built in order to create a space for the Ventura County Resource Center. It is the website which residents of Ventura County can turn to in order to get help they need and to volunteer for giving said help.

### Credit goes to HTML5UP for creating the template I used for this website.
